Lazy Loading

We utilize React's React.lazy and Suspense for on-demand component loading, optimizing the application's performance. This approach ensures faster initial load times by splitting the code into smaller chunks.

Error Handling

The app gracefully handles API errors and network issues, providing meaningful feedback to users.

Data Visualization

Interactive charts powered by Chart.js display historical cryptocurrency price trends. The app dynamically adjusts the chart's appearance based on user-selected time ranges.

üåü Highlights
